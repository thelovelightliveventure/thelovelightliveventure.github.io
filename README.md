# My homepage

This is my homepage! There are a few `HTML` files, a `CSS` file, and a few others miscellaneous ones.

### `index.html`

This page is the `home page` of my website.

```
<html>
[...]
</html>
```

### `coofects.html`

This page is the `cool effects page` of my website. It's also the best page ever. In the navigation it is called `Sandbox/Playground`.

```
<html>
[...]
</html>
```

### `info.html`

This page provides more information about the three programming languages displayed on `index.html`.

```
<html>
[...]
</html>
```

### `contact.html`

This page includes my social media links.

```
<html>
[...]
</html>
```

### `styles.css`

This page includes a bunch of styling stuff — the fun colors and shadows.

```
p {
    [...]
}
[...]
```

### `template.html`

This page is not in the nav menu, so most users will not view this page. I use this as a template for all my other pages.

```
<html>
[...]
</html>
```
